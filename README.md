Introduction:

This project aims to demonstrate the application of reinforcement learning in training an AI agent to play the Snake game. The game features a Snake that can be controlled by a human player or an AI agent. The AI agent learns to play the game autonomously by making decisions to maximize its score.

Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/blackmamba-ops/Snake-Reinforcement-Learning.git

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   pip install pygame torch numpy matplotlib

Usage:

1. Run the Snake game:
   python game.py

2. To train the AI agent using reinforcement learning:
   python agent.py

Game Controls:

- Arrow keys: Control the Snake's movements (human player mode)

AI Agent:

The AI agent uses reinforcement learning to learn how to play the Snake game. It observes the game state, chooses actions, and updates its model based on rewards received. The agent aims to maximize its score through a combination of exploration and exploitation strategies.
