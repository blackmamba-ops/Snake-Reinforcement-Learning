# Teach AI To Play Snake! Reinforcement Learning With PyTorch and Pygame

Let's break down the entire Snake game code in simple terms, step by step:

**Importing Dependencies:**

We're using the pygame library to create a game.
We also import other necessary modules for functionality.

**Constants and Colors:**

We define some basic constants like colors and game parameters.
Colors like white, red, and blue are used to draw on the screen.
We set the block size and speed for the snake's movement.

**Direction and Point:**

We create an enumeration called Direction to represent the possible movement directions of the snake (up, down, left, right).
We also create a Point named tuple to represent positions on the screen with x and y coordinates.

**SnakeGame Class:**

This class defines the entire Snake game logic.

__init__(self, w=640, h=480):

We set up the initial game state.
The display window dimensions are provided (defaulting to 640x480).
We create the game display window and set its title.
The game clock helps control the game speed.

*__place_food(self):_*

This method randomly places food on the screen for the snake to eat.
We ensure the food doesn't appear on the snake's body.

*play_step(self):*

This method represents a single step in the game loop.
It handles user input (arrow keys) to control the snake's direction.
The snake's movement is updated based on the chosen direction.
We check for collisions with the screen boundaries or the snake's body.
If the snake eats the food, the score increases, and new food is placed.
The display is updated with the current game state.
The game clock helps control the game speed.
The method returns whether the game is over and the current score.

*_is_collision(self):*

This method checks for collisions with the screen boundaries or the snake's body.
If the snake hits the walls or itself, a collision is detected.

*_update_ui(self):*

This method updates the display to show the snake, food, and score.
It draws rectangles to represent the snake segments, food, and score text.
The display is updated to show these elements.

*_move(self, direction):*

This method updates the snake's head position based on the chosen direction.
The snake's head moves in the specified direction (up, down, left, right).

**Game Loop:**

We start the main game loop by creating an instance of the SnakeGame class.

**Print Final Score:**

After the game loop ends, we print the final score achieved in the game.

**Exiting the Game:**

We close the pygame library to exit the game and release resources.

**Version 1: Simple Snake Game**

This version of the code creates a basic Snake game where a human player can control the snake's movements using arrow keys. The player's objective is to eat the food and avoid collisions with the screen boundaries or the snake's own body.

**Version 2: AI Agent-controlled Snake Game (Reinforcement Learning)**

In this version, an AI agent learns to play the Snake game using reinforcement learning. The agent controls the snake's movements and aims to maximize its score by making decisions based on the game state and rewards.
